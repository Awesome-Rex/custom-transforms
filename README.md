# REX Custom Transforms
 
Provides a method of creating a parent-child link between disconnected objects in the hierarchy. This allows you to create nested rigidbodies with gravity using the CustomGravity component.

This unity package can be very useful for creating moving platorms, rotating platforms, planets and ridable spaceships. For space games where players can move inside spaceships, scripts in this package can be *essential*.
