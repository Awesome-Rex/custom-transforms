	"description": 
		"A package containing scripts for restricting gameobject orientation to fit desired results. \nScripts can be used to ignore parent position, rotation and scale or be used to create parent-child links between disconnected gameobjects. This may come in useful for creating connections to MOVING PLATFORMS, VEHICLES and SPACESHIPS without the need to parent objects while sacrificing child physics.",
